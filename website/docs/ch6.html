<P>Macros</A></B>
<blockquote>

<P>An example of a macro definition using the <tt>\op</tt> function is:
<blockquote>
<tt><P>\set{iplusplus}{\quote{\set{i}{\op{\i}{+}{1}}}}</tt>.
</blockquote>
<P>This creates a command which increases the value of the variable <I>i</I> 
by one.  Therefore,
<blockquote>
<tt><P>\set{i}{1} \get{i}
<P>\iplusplus \get{i}
<P>\iplusplus \get{i}
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>generates <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>, and <tt>3</tt> as output.

<P>Arguments may be passed to invoked variables just like to primitives, using 
the symbols <tt>\1</tt>, <tt>\2</tt>, <tt>\3</tt>, and so on.  For instance, 
the command <tt>\set{echo}{\quote{\1}}</tt> creates a macro <tt>\echo</tt> 
which simply returns whatever was given in its first argument.  A 
comparatively more useful macro is defined by the command
<blockquote>
<tt><P>\set{inc}{\quote{
<P>  \set{\1}{
<P>    \op{
<P>      \get{\1}
<P>    }{+}{1}
<P>  }
<P>}}
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>Instead of writing a separate macro to increment the variable <I>j</I> by 
one, we may use <tt>\inc{i}</tt> or <tt>\inc{j}</tt> to add one to either 
<I>i</I> or <I>j</I>, respectively.

<P>Macros are defined in exactly the same way as variables, except that we 
must tell the interpreter not to expand the GUML code inside the definition.  
This is done with the <tt>\quote</tt> command:

<tt><P>\quote{</tt><I>string</I><tt>}</tt>  - returns the string <I>string</I> 
exactly as written, not expanding any GUML within.

<P>Consider the following snippet of code:
<blockquote>
<tt><P>\set{b}{zoiks}
<P>\set{a}{\get{b}}
<P>\set{b}{murp}
<P>\a
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>This returns the string &quot;zoiks&quot;, because the command 
<tt>\set{a}{\get{b}}</tt> sets the value of the variable <I>a</I> to the 
value given in the second argument to <tt>\set</tt>, which is, in this case, 
the result of the command <tt>\get{b}</tt>—the string &quot;zoiks&quot;.  
If we change this to:
<blockquote>
<tt><P>\set{b}{zoiks}
<P>\set{a}{\quote{\get{b}}}
<P>\set{b}{murp}
<P>\a
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>it instead returns the string &quot;murp&quot;.  In this case, the command 
<tt>\set{a}{\quote{\get{b}}}</tt> sets the value of the variable <I>a</I> to 
the string &quot;\get{b}&quot;.  The command <tt>\a</tt> tells the GUML 
interpreter to retrieve the contents of <I>a</I> and interpret any GUML code 
within.  The command <tt>\get{a}</tt>, on the other hand, tells the 
interpreter <I>not</I> to expand any GUML code found inside, only to present 
the contents exactly as stored.  Thus, if a variable contains user-entered 
data, you should <I>always</I> retrieve it with the <tt>\get</tt> function.  
If the data contains any of the GUML meta-characters (<tt>\</tt>, <tt>{</tt>, 
<tt>}</tt>, and <tt>#</tt>), expanding it with the backslash operator is 
certain to produce unexpected results.  Again, only when you can be absolutely 
certain that none of GUML's special characters will be in a variable's 
contents should you consider using the backslash to retrieve data from a 
variable.

<P>For example, the file <tt>headers/html_fmt</tt> includes the following 
definition:
<blockquote>
<tt><P>\set{conttype}{\quote{
<P>  \if{\not{\isset{conttyped}}}{
<P>    {Content-type: text/html\n\if{\1}{\1\n}\n}
<P>    \set{conttyped}{}# Don't let it happen more than once!
<P>  }
<P>}}
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>Of course, the same result could be achieved by testing the variable 
<I>conttyped</I> for a certain value which the procedure sets.  In fact, when 
regarding the output only as a &quot;truth&quot; value, the functions 
<tt>\get</tt> and <tt>\isset</tt> are nearly identical, since <tt>\get</tt> 
also returns an empty string when a variable has not yet been set. The key 
difference is when the argument is a variable that has been set to the empty 
string; <tt>\get</tt> returns the empty string, while <tt>\isset</tt> returns 
&quot;true&quot;.  Whether one tests for a variable’s existence or its 
value is, for the most part, irrelevant and strictly a matter of personal 
preference and programming style.

<A NAME="header"><B>Header Files</B></a>
<blockquote>
To prevent a profusion of repeated function definitions, GUML is equipped
with a primitive which allows data to be read in from another file.  The
command <tt>\include{</tt><i>filename</i><tt>}</tt> reads in the text from
the file named <I>filename</I>, interpreting it exactly as if it had been
cut and pasted into the original file.  Thus, a macro which is used in many
programs need only be defined once.  This allows libraries of function
definitions to be constructed and accessed easily, facilitating the
extensibility which is the wellspring of GUML's power.

<p>

The files located in the <tt>headers</tt> directory each contain a number
of macros that simplify life, all built up in terms of the primitives.
These macro definitions are loaded by using the <tt>\include</tt> command,
as described previously.

<p>

Specifically, the file <tt>headers/plain_fmt</tt> specifies all of the
plain format commands; the file <tt>headers/html_fmt</tt> contains a
standard set of HTML command macros.  Most sites have at least one site 
specific header file such as <tt>headers/molson</tt> which contains
a series of GUML macros designed specifically for the Molson site.  
There is typically a <tt>headers/error_fmt</tt> file which defines 
appropriate error messages for the site.

<p>

Full descriptions of all macros in the header files is appended.

<B><P><A NAME="error">
<P>Error Handling</A></B>
<blockquote>

<P>GUML handles errors through two variables.  The controlling variable, 
<tt>ERROR</tt>, is a special one.  Once it is set, all outstanding groups are 
automatically ended without prejudice.  The variable remains set and is 
expected to be outputted verbatim by the top level function.

<P>Normally, <tt>ERROR</tt> will be set by a macro, <tt>\error</tt>, which 
will be triggered either by an internal error in the parser or by GUML code.  
If an internal error in executing GUML is encountered, it will try to run 
<tt>\error</tt> with an argument giving the type of error as a text string 
containing English.  If <tt>\error</tt> is undefined, which could happen in 
the case of a grievous error, it prints a frantic message to that effect and 
kills the process.  Thus, it is a good idea to always have your formats 
incorporate an error processing command which will take care of setting 
<tt>ERROR</tt>.  <tt>headers/plain_fmt</tt> inputs the file 
<tt>headers/error_fmt</tt>, which should contain an error-handling routine.

<P>One's own uses of <tt>\error</tt> should be in GUML code when something has 
gone wrong requiring immediate cessation of expansion.  A message should be in 
the first argument, which will then be outputted.  For instance,
<blockquote>
<tt><P>\if{
<P>  \not{\isset{USER}}
<P>}{
<P>  \error{You must be registered to use this page!}
<P>}
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>will block non-users from a document, with a notice as to why.

<P>In the case of a bad filename or a file-not-found error, the special GUML file
<tt><P>headers/file-not-found</tt> will be loaded.  This should contain 
instructions to set <tt>ERROR</tt> appropriately.
<p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME="recur"><B>Recursion</B></a>
<blockquote>
Here are some sample macros which illustrate the capabilities of GUML.  We
assume two macros from the plain format, <tt>\n</tt> (newline) and
<tt>\ne</tt> (not-equals), are defined.  First, the macro <tt>\rectangle</tt>
produces a rectangle of <tt>*</tt>'s with parameters specified.

<blockquote>

<pre>
\set{starbar}{\quote{
   \if{
      \op{\1}{&gt;}{0}
   }{
      {*}
      \starbar{\op{\1}{-}{1}}
   }
}}
 
\set{rectangle}{\quote{
   \if{
      \op{\2}{&gt;}{0}
   }{
      \starbar{\1}
      \n
      \rectangle{\1}{\op{\2}{-}{1}}
   }
}}
</pre>

</blockquote>

You may test this with <tt>\rectangle{\rand{40}}{\rand{8}}</tt>.  Note that
using this recursion method you may inadvertently create an infinite loop;
to guard against these cases, the parser automatically frantically kills
the process with an abrupt message if a certain large maximum recursion
depth is reached.

</blockquote>

<A NAME="arrays"><B>Arrays</B></a>

<blockquote>

One may also simulate arrays in GUML.  The macro <tt>\backandforth</tt>
prints a sequence of ten random one-digit numbers, and then prints them in
reverse order.

<blockquote>

<pre>
\set{doloop}{\quote{
   \if{
      \ne{\1}{\2}
   }{
      \set{_doloop_tmp}{\4}
      \_doloop_tmp{\1}
      \doloop{\op{\1}{+}{\3}}{\2}{\3}{\4}
   }
}}

\set{backandforth}{\quote{
   \doloop{0}{20}{1}{
      \quote{\set{array_\1}{\rand{10}}\get{array_\1}\ }
   }
   \n
   \doloop{19}{-1}{-1}{\quote{\get{array_\1}\ }}
   \n
}}

</pre>

</blockquote>

Note that "associative arrays" may be formed in essentially the same way.

</blockquote>

<A NAME="db"><B>Database Connectivity</B></a>

<blockquote>

Interface to the Informix, MS SQL Server, Mysql, Oracle, and Sybase databases 
is effected via two commands, <tt>\sqlexec</tt> and <tt>\sqlrow</tt>.  
<tt>\sqlexec</tt> sends its first argument to the database.  
If it is supposed to return exactly one batch, one then uses <tt>\sqlrow</tt> 
to retrieve the results row-by-row.  It takes as arguments a series of 
variables which are then loaded with the respective columns.  
A blank entry means that column is ignored.  <tt>\sqlrow</tt>
returns a true value on success, a false value if no more values could be
found and none were loaded.

<p>

The following sample code uses the <tt>\while</tt> primitive to retrieve the
result set of records from a SQL query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
\sqlexec{
   select userID, name from userProfile
}

\while{
   \sqlrow{id}{nm}
}{
   User `\get{id}' is named `\get{nm}'.
}
</pre>
