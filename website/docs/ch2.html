<blockquote>

Programming in GUML is best done understanding several aspects of the
language, including its syntax, how it treats variables and some simple
logical structures and operations.  In this section, we'll cover each
of these and more (listed above) in detail.

<P>

To better introduce the programming of GUML, we will use several examples.
If these seem confusing at first, this is likely because we'll be introducing
variables and primitives before we have a chance to discuss them in depth.
When in doubt, focus on the structure of the example, rather than its
specific function.  We will cover variables, primitives and macros in due
course.  Where appropriate, we provide counter-examples in PERL (note: we
use the PERL "print" command to duplicate standard commands in GUML, as that
is essentially GUML's basic function -- to evaluate commands and print their
results).

<P>

Once you've completed Part II, you should be able to program in GUML without
any difficulty.  Spend some time getting familiar with the primitives and
GUMLs features before moving on to Part III and some more advanced methods
of programming.

<A NAME="syntax"><B>Syntax</B></a>

<blockquote>

When reading a file, the GUML interpreter scans input for certain characters
which indicate that subsequent text is to be taken as a GUML command.
Everything else--that input it decides isn't intended for it--is piped
directly to output.  This enables the GUML programmer to embed HTML and
JavaScript statements within GUML files.  Since these are clearly not
intended for GUML's interpretation, they get passed right along without
adulteration.

<P>The special characters that GUML looks out for are:

<blockquote>
<tt>\</tt> - Backslash indicates the beginning of a GUML command.
<br>
<tt>{</tt> - Left brace opens a block of text as part of an argument to a GUML command.
<br>
<tt>}</tt> - Right brace ends a block of text inteded to be grouped as an argument.<br>
<tt>#</tt> - Pound sign indicates the rest of the line is a comment, and should not be output or evaluated.

<i><b>What is an argument?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
In GUML, as in most programming languages, an argument is a parameter which 
helps a command to behave properly.<br>
In the simplest case of mathematical operations, arguments are the numbers and 
commands are the operators.  So "2+3" has the arguments "2" and "3", and the 
command "+".<br>
Using the example above, in GUML this would be: <tt>\op{2}{+}{3}</tt>.  In 
this case, the command is the primitive "<tt>\op</tt>" (primitives are 
discussed mor in depth in Part IV).  The three arguments give the kind of 
operation (addition) and the numbers to add.<br>
This is similar, although not directly analogous, to HTML's tags.  The 
&lt;IMG&gt; tag, for example requires a "SRC" argument, and can have "BORDER", 
"WIDTH", etc...<br></i>
</blockquote>
<p>

If you wish to use any of these four special characters as plain text, you
may precede any of them with a "<tt>\</tt>".  Viz., "<tt>\\</tt>" produces
"<tt>\</tt>", "<tt>\{</tt>" produces "<tt>{</tt>", "<tt>\}</tt>" produces
"<tt>}</tt>", and "<tt>\#</tt>" produces "<tt>#</tt>".  This latter one is
especially useful in HTML where you wish to use special characters (i.e.
&amp;#160; would need to be rendered as &amp;\#160;).

<P>

Using these special characters, the general form of a GUML command is:

<blockquote><tt><i>\command{argument1}{argument2}...</i></tt></blockquote>

This differs significantly from HTML tags and C functions insofar as there
is not a bracket pair which serves to enclose all the arguments to the
command, i.e.:

<blockquote>
HTML: <tt>&lt;IMG src="sample.gif"&gt;</tt>
<br>
PERL: <tt>&amp;SubRoutine(arg1, arg2);</tt>
</blockquote>

In GUML, there is no (practical) upper limit to the number of arguments for
a command.  Generally, if too few arguments are specified, the remaining
ones will be assumed to be the empty argument <tt>{}</tt>.  If too many are
specified, the result of the extra ones will be disregarded, although they
will be evaluated.  This is important, as extraneous, but evaluated,
arguments that are syntactically incorrect will cause server errors due the
inability of GUML to correctly parse the file.

<P>

GUML's parser allows commands to be nested to perform complex calculations
or evaluations to render a page.  This means that the output of a command
may be an argument to another command.  For example:

<blockquote><tt>\op{2}{+}{\op{5}{-}{2}}</tt></blockquote>

Here, the result of <tt>\op{5}{-}{2}</tt> (or 3) is used as the third
argument for the first <tt>\op</tt>, so it evaluates as
<tt>\op{2}{+}{3}</tt>, or 5.  Like arguments, there is no practical upper
limit to the amount of command nesting, and consequently the complexity of
an operation.  For debugging and readability purposes, it is suggested that,
just as in C or other languages, reasonable attention be paid to the format
of GUML code.  The above example could, and perhaps should, be rewritten as:

<blockquote>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH=590>
<TR>
	<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP"><tt><i><b>GUML</b></i></tt></TD>
	<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP"><tt><i><b>PERL</b></i></tt></TD>
</TR><TR>
	<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP">
<pre>
\op{2}{+}{
   \op{5}{-}{2}
}
</pre>
	</TD>
	<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP">
<pre>
print 2 + (5 - 2);
</pre>
	</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

</blockquote>

Functionally, this causes no problem as the additional whitespace characters
(i.e. returns, tabs and spaces) are simply not interpreted by the GUML
parser.  It is important to remember that any macro or primitive can be
nested within another, a slightly more interesting (and useful) example is:

<blockquote>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH=590>
<TR>
	<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP"><tt><i><b>GUML</b></i></tt></TD>
	<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP"><tt><i><b>PERL</b></i></tt></TD>
</TR><TR>
	<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP">
<pre>
\set{addme}{
   \op{5}{-}{2}
}
\op{2}{+}{
   \get{addme}
}
</pre>
	</TD>
	<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP">
<pre>
$addme = 5 - 2;
print 2 + $addme;
</pre>
	</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

</blockquote>

Here, we set a variable, named "addme", to a value, then add it to the
number 2.  Having used several examples with primitives and variables, let's
take a quick spin around the various primitives within GUML.

</blockquote>

<A NAME="overview"><B>A Brief Overview Of Primitives</B></a>

<blockquote>

Primitives are commands which form the foundation of GUML.  How these
commands work is defined directly in the source code of GUML, and they can
be used by any file that is passed to the GUML parser.  This structure
enables a high degree of programmability and customization as only the most
vital and basic commands are part of the core GUML program.  This helps keep
GUML efficient by preventing unneeded commands from being loaded into memory.

<P>

Here, we'll briefly introduce some of the primitives with a short description
of their function.  In the primitives listed below, any primitive whose
function is to test for a certain condition will return the value "true" or
"" (for false) where appropriate.  For more in-depth examples and
explanations, consult Part IV.

</blockquote>

In addition to this list and the reference in Part IV, we will introduce
several of these primitives in detail in specific examples and applications
of GUML in the following sections.

</blockquote>

<A NAME="mode"><B>Command vs. Text Mode</B></a>

<blockquote>

When parsing a file, processing an argument, or expanding a variable, GUML
begins in command mode (a.k.a. cmode).  The main feature of this mode is that
all whitespace is ignored, so one can put in blank lines, indentation, or
tabs as one wishes without it being outputted.  In text mode (a.k.a., tmode),
on the other hand, spaces, tabs, and newlines are outputted normally, as one
would want in text.  When the group, argument, or variable ends, GUML returns
to whatever mode it was in before, either cmode or tmode.

<p>

One can switch between modes by hand by using the <tt>\cmode</tt> and
<tt>\tmode</tt> primitives.  Also, as soon as any text is encountered, text
mode is automatically started.  As such, the distinction between modes is
tenuous at best, and probably best forgotten--particularly in the case of
GUML-generated HTML in which formatting will be ignored by the browser
anyway.  Simply remember that everything that isn't a command will be
outputted by the processor.

<p>

Leading spaces at the start of the line are ignored in either mode.  Use of a
"control-space", a backslash followed by a space, can be used to force output
of a space.  A backslash at the end of a line also forces leading spaced on
the next line to be read in.

</blockquote>

<B><a name=note>A Note on Data Types</B></a>
<blockquote>

<P>Many languages have several different kinds of data types (i.e. integers, 
strings, arrays, etc.).  This allows programmers to interact with and 
manipulate data using functions and commands that make sense for that data 
type (for example, multiplying strings doesn't make much sense).

<P>In GUML there is only one data type, the string.  Functions which expect 
numbers, like <tt>\op</tt>, first convert their input to numbers, perform the 
requested calculation, then convert the result to a string.  In this way, we 
need not worry about what type of data is in a variable, nor whether a 
function is being called with the right type of input.  When a function tries 
this conversion on a string which doesn't represent a number, like 
&quot;blammo&quot;, the input is taken to be zero.  Thus, the result of the 
command <tt>\op{work}{+}{toil}</tt> is the string &quot;0&quot;.
<p>
<i><B>What is a string?</B>
<P>
<blockquote>
A string is a character or group of characters which is being treated as
characters (as opposed to numbers.)  As in most programming languages, the
positioning of characters in a string begins at 0;  for example, in the
string &quot;<TT>ska</TT>&quot;, the character &quot;<TT>s</TT>&quot;
is in the position 0, &quot;<TT>k</TT>&quot; is in the position 1,
etc., when you index into (or refer to a specific character in) the string.
The counting of the number of the characters (or length) still begins at 1,
so that the length of &quot;<TT>ska</TT>&quot; is 3, although
&quot;<TT>a</TT>&quot; is in the position 2.</i>
