<blockquote>

This document is directed towards the capable HTML programmer who may, or
may not, have a more extensive background in a major programming language.
Some exposure to PERL or another language is assumed, as we do not cover
many of the basics of scripting and programming.  Anyone with significant
experience in PERL, C or Java, however, should find this document easy to
digest.

<P>

In the case of some outstanding questions which may be unfamiliar to
scripting and engineering novices, we've included sidebars that answer some
questions which the experienced reader will wish to skip (i.e. "What's an
argument?").

<B><a NAME="1.1">What Is GUML?</A></B>

<blockquote>

GUML is a simple, user-extensible, macro-based, meta language for generating
documents on-the-fly.  Specifically, it allows for rapid development of
dynamic content in World Wide Web pages without requiring knowledge of C
programming or the CGI interface.  GUML, simply, is an extension to HTML,
opening up the necessary control for dynamic content to the World Wide Web
publisher or designer.  These extensions take commonly used and needed
programming tools and place them, with a simple language, in the hands of
designers to make HTML more than a simple markup language.

</blockquote>

<B><A NAME="1.2">Why Use GUML?</A></B>

<blockquote>

GUML is built from a small set of primitive functions, to which may be
added any number of user-defined macros.  Additionally, application-specific
primitives, such as database access or higher math functions, are easily
incorporated into the core as needed.  Since GUML is based on robust
technologies, like C, and has a highly flexibile nature allowing it to
connect with a variety of databases, it provides a cross-platform solution
to dynamic content on the World Wide Web.  This cross-platform nature
enables the leveraging of content across multiple server platforms, multiple
Web servers and multiple database servers. GUML is elegant, yet powerful--it
frees the development of content from the confines of machinery.

<B><A NAME="1.3">How Does GUML Work?</A></B>

<blockquote>

The GUML interpreter is a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application which
is executed, most typically, through an http request to a Web server.  Along
with the request, GUML is told which input file it needs to handle (i.e.
"page" on the Web) and proceeds to parse the file based upon GUMLs primitive
functions and any defined macros.  A plain text HTML file is generated
through this process and sent back to the user through the http server.  In
the case of database access, GUML provides the bridge between the Web server
and the database server, understanding how to communicate with each,
therefore enabling content variant upon the contents of a database.
