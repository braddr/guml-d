<A NAME="3.1"><B>Header Files</B>

<blockquote>

To prevent a profusion of repeated function definitions, GUML is equipped
with a primitive which allows data to be read in from another file.  The
command <tt>\include{</tt><i>filename</i><tt>}</tt> reads in the text from
the file named <I>filename</I>, interpreting it exactly as if it had been
cut and pasted into the original file.  Thus, a macro which is used in many
programs need only be defined once.  This allows libraries of function
definitions to be constructed and accessed easily, facilitating the
extensibility which is the wellspring of GUML's power.

<p>

The files located in the <tt>headers</tt> directory each contain a number
of macros that simplify life, all built up in terms of the primitives.
These macro definitions are loaded by using the <tt>\include</tt> command,
as described previously.

<p>

Specifically, the file <tt>headers/plain_fmt</tt> specifies all of the
plain format commands; the file <tt>headers/html_fmt</tt> contains a
standard set of HTML command macros; the file <tt>headers/chicago</tt> is
a series of GUML macros designed specifically for the Chicago project; the
file <tt>headers/formulae</tt> contains the mathematical functions used in
computations in the Chicago project; and the file <tt>headers/dave_fmt</tt>
contains additional numeric and string manipulation routines.

<p>

Full descriptions of all macros in the header files is appended.

<A NAME="3.2"><B>Recursion</B>

<blockquote>

Here are some sample macros which illustrate the capabilities of GUML.  We
assume two macros from the plain format, <tt>\n</tt> (newline) and
<tt>\ne</tt> (not-equals), are defined.  First, the macro <tt>\rectangle</tt>
produces a rectangle of <tt>*</tt>'s with parameters specified.

<blockquote>

<pre>
\set{starbar}{\quote{
   \if{
      \op{\1}{&gt;}{0}
   }{
      {*}
      \starbar{\op{\1}{-}{1}}
   }
}}
 
\set{rectangle}{\quote{
   \if{
      \op{\2}{&gt;}{0}
   }{
      \starbar{\1}
      \n
      \rectangle{\1}{\op{\2}{-}{1}}
   }
}}
</pre>

</blockquote>

You may test this with <tt>\rectangle{\rand{40}}{\rand{8}}</tt>.  Note that
using this recursion method you may inadvertently create an infinite loop;
to guard against these cases, the parser automatically frantically kills
the process with an abrupt message if a certain large maximum recursion
depth is reached.

</blockquote>

<A NAME="3.3"><B>Loops</B>

<blockquote>

One may also simulate arrays in GUML.  The macro <tt>\backandforth</tt>
prints a sequence of ten random one-digit numbers, and then prints them in
reverse order.

<blockquote>

<pre>
\set{doloop}{\quote{
   \if{
      \ne{\1}{\2}
   }{
      \set{_doloop_tmp}{\4}
      \_doloop_tmp{\1}
      \doloop{\op{\1}{+}{\3}}{\2}{\3}{\4}
   }
}}

\set{backandforth}{\quote{
   \doloop{0}{20}{1}{
      \quote{\set{array_\1}{\rand{10}}\get{array_\1}\ }
   }
   \n
   \doloop{19}{-1}{-1}{\quote{\get{array_\1}\ }}
   \n
}}

</pre>

</blockquote>

Note that "associative arrays" may be formed in essentially the same way.

</blockquote>

<A NAME="3.4"><B>Database Connectivity</B>

<blockquote>

Interface to the Sybase database is effected via two commands,
<tt>\sqlexec</tt> and <tt>\sqlrow</tt>.  <tt>\sqlexec</tt> sends its first
argument to Sybase.  If it is supposed to return exactly one batch, one
then uses <tt>\sqlrow</tt> to retrieve the results row-by-row.  It takes
as arguments a series of variables which are then loaded with the respective
columns.  A blank entry means that column is ignored.  <tt>\sqlrow</tt>
returns a true value on success, a false value if no more values could be
found and none were loaded.

<p>

The following sample code uses the <tt>\while</tt> primitive to retrieve the
result set of records from a SQL query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
\sqlexec{
   select userID, name from userProfile
}

\while{
   \sqlrow{id}{nm}
}{
   User `\get{id}' is named `\get{nm}'.
}
</pre>
